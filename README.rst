Prestans is a REST micro-framework built right on top of WSGI, designed to perform and co-exists with other middleware and frameworks that you employ. Our target audience are developers building large REST backends for use with pure Ajax (using a framework like Google Closure) or mobile applications. prestans is designed for you to "take as much or as little" as you like.

We recommend you install via `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/prestans/>`_.

Features:

- Built right on top of WSGI, designed ground up to cooperate with other frameworks
- Strong representative of REST philosophies leveraging HTTP headers and verbs
- Support for multiple dialects, including formalised patterns for binary content 
- Handlers maps HTTP verbs to implemented class methods, complimented  with custom request parser and response writer (built on top of WebOb)
- Unforgivingly strict parsing of requests and responses to ensure data integrity
- Helper methods to ease transformation of persistent objects to REST responses
- Pluggable integration to authentication

Prestans ensures that we provide extensive and useful documentation, published at available on `Read The Docs <http://docs.prestans.org>`_. Sphinx source available on `Github <http://github.com/prestans/prestans-docs/>`_.

Prestans also offers a set of `client side tools <https://github.com/prestans/prestans-client/>`_ to compliment Google Closure.

If you are still wondering prestans is a latin word meaning "excellent, distinguished, imminent."

When reporting issues:

- Include as much detail as you can about your environment (e.g Server OS, Web Server Version, WSGI connector)
